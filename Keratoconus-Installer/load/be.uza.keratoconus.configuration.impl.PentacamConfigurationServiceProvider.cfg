# Path to the base icon file, relative to directory 'resource/' within the
# systemtrayapp bundle.  The application will use variant versions of 
# this icon if it finds them: the variants are formed by adding "-main",
# "-side", "-ambiguous", "-normal", "-bad", and "-large" to the file name
# just before the final dot and extension, e.g. 'icon/ktc.jpg' =>
# 'icon/ktc-main.jpg'.  If no such variant is found then the base icon will
# be used.
