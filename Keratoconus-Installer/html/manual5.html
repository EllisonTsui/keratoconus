     <h2>User preferences</h2>
     
     <p>Many aspects of the application's behaviour can be modified by right-clicking on the system tray icon and selecting the 
     &ldquo;User&nbsp;preferences&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo; option from the menu which is presented.
     <dl>
     <dt>Patent records
     <dd>Selects the directory to which the graphical patient record files will be written.
     <dt>Result display
     <dd>Selects which options (animate taskbar icon, show taskbar messages, show floating popups) are used to provide visual feedback to the user.
     <dt>Popup window
     <dd>Determines the &ldquo;decorations&rdquo; which are applied to the pop-up window ranging from none at all (UNDECORATED) to a full
     window frame complete with minimise, maximise, and close buttons.  Selecting UTILITY has the side-effect that the window is not shown
     in the task bar or when pressing ALT_TAB.
     <dt>Popup position
     <dd>Selects the position on the screen where the pop-up will appear.  Note that the pop-up can be dragged to another position
     on the screen, even if it does not have a title bar; however each new patient report will appear at the selected position.
     <dt>Popup display time
     <dd>Allows the time for which the pop-up is displayed to be set, according to the category of the result;
     for example you could chose to have <span class="N">No indication</span> show only for a few seconds, while the main indications
     <span class="KTC">Keratoconus</span> and <span class="PR">Post-refractive</span> are shown for much longer.
     <dt>Chart type
     <dd>Choice of chart type used for the detailed breakdown of probabilities: bar chart or pie chart.
     </dl>
     <p>Changes are effected and persisted immediately, except that a change to <b>Popup window</b> will only become effective
     after restarting the application.
