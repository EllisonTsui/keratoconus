    <h2>Dubious cases</h2>
    <p>In most cases the neural network will choose confidently for one of the five categories, but occasionally it
    is unable to make such a clear-cut decision.  In this case the result will be classified as:
    <dl>
    <dt><span class=Ambiguous>Ambiguous</span>
    <dd>Unable to confidently assign the data to one of the five main categories.
    </dl>
    <p>In the case of patients with an unusually thick cornea the neural net model does not work well.
    Therefore it is not applied in such cases, and the result will be displayed as:
    <dl>
    <dt><span class=Ambiguous>Thick Cornea</span>
    <dd>Abnormally thick cornea, no classification can be performed.
    </dl>
    <p>Even when the result of the classification
    seems clear it can only be regarded as a suggestion as to whether further tests should be performed and not as a diagnosis (positive or
    negative).  Although the system has been trained on a large number of cases and has exhibited a high degree of accuracy in trials (>90%),
    it is no substitute for the judgement of a trained ophthalmologist.  The classification is also based entirely on the tomography data,
    whereas the ophthalmologist also has access to other sources of information such as the patient's own description, family history,
    presence of other pathologies commonly found in association with keratoconus, etc..
