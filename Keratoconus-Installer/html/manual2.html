    <h2>Classification</h2>
        <p>The neural network attempts to classify the tomography data into one of five categories:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt><span class=KTC>Keratoconus</span>
    <dd>There is an indication of frank keratoconus.
    <dt><span class=PR>Post-refractive</span>
    <dd>The patient shows signs of having undergone post-refractive surgery, the aftermath of which can mimic keratoconus and present some of the same risks.
        The judgement of the ophthalmologist is essential to distinguish reliably between these two categories.
    <dt><span class=FF>Suspicious</span>
    <dd>There is some indication of keratoconus, but if it is present then it is not fully developed.
    (Sometimes referred to as &ldquo;forme fruste&rdquo; keratoconus).
    <dt><span class=Astig>Astigmatism</span>
    <dd>The patient exhibits pronounced astigmatism but not of the kind associated with keratoconus.
    <dt><span class=N>No indication</span>
    <dd>There is little or no indication of keratoconus, strong astigmatism, or refractive surgery.
    </dl>
<p>In most cases the neural network will choose confidently for one of the five categories, but occasionally it
    is unable to make such a clear-cut decision.  In this case the result will be classified as:
    <dl>
    <dt><span class=Ambiguous>Ambiguous</span>
    <dd>Unable to confidently assign the data to one of the five main categories.
    </dl>
    <p>In the case of patients with an unusually thick cornea the neural network model does not work well.
    (In fact keratoconus is very unlikely to be present.)
    Therefore the model is not applied in these cases, and the result will be displayed as:
    <dl>
    <dt><span class=Ambiguous>Thick Cornea</span>
    <dd>Abnormally thick cornea, no classification can be performed.
    </dl>
