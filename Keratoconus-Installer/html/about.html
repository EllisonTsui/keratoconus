<h2>Notice</h2>

<p class="license">The Keratoconus Assistant software package is intended as a decision support system, providing physicians with an automated screening tool for keratoconus. This software is not intended to replace the comprehensive anamnesis, ophthalmic examination or appropriate diagnostic measurements deemed the standard protocol in keratoconus assessment. Instead, it is to be used in conjunction with this standard protocol, and provide an objective point of view  based on machine learning analysis. The results provided by the Keratoconus Assistant are therefore not to be considered as a medical instruction by the developers. The responsibility for any medical decisions based on this software’s results remains solely with the physician using it, who should come to his own, independent conclusions regarding the proper treatment of their patient, taking all available medical information into account.</p>

<p class="license">Although the developers have verified the results in a clinical environment and have performed an extensive reliability analysis, they cannot guarantee an accurate assessment in every case. The software, its features, and its guidelines may also be subject to changes without prior notice. </p>

<p class="license">By using Keratoconus Assistant the user accepts the full responsibility for the interpretation of the results of the software in their proper clinical context, taking all available information into account. Furthermore, by using Keratoconus Assistant the user pledges to refrain from making any claims against the developers related to the use of the software.</p>
