    <h1>About the Keratoconus Assistant</h1>
    <h2>General principles</h2>
    <p>The Keratoconus Assistant is an expert system developed at the University Hospital (Universitair Ziekenhuis) of Antwerp
    to assist ophthalmic practitioners in detecting cases of Keratoconus.  It functions in association with the Oculus Pentacam
    software; each time that a corneal tomography scan is performed or a previous scan is recalled, the data provided by the Pentacam
    software is fed into a neural network which has been trained to recognise possible cases of Keratoconus.
    The result of this analysis is then displayed in a pop-up window.</p>
    <p>The neural network attempts to classify the tomography data into one of five categories:</p>
    <dl>
    <dt><span class=KTC>Keratoconus</span>
    <dd>There is an indication of frank keratoconus.
    <dt><span class=PR>Post-refractive</span>
    <dd>The patient shows signs of having undergone post-refractive surgery, the aftermath of which can mimic keratoconus and present some of the same risks.
        The judgement of the ophthalmologist is essential to distinguish reliably between these two categories.
    <dt><span class=FF>Suspicious</span>
    <dd>There is some indication of keratoconus, but if it is present then it is not fully developed.
    (Sometimes referred to as &ldquo;forme fruste&rdquo; keratoconus).
    <dt><span class=Astig>Astigmatism</span>
    <dd>The patient exhibits pronounced astigmatism but not of the kind associated with keratoconus.
    <dt><span class=N>No indication</span>
    <dd>There is little or no indication of keratoconus, strong astigmatism, or refractive surgery.
