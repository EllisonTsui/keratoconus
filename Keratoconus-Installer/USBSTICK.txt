USB STICK

If the files in this directory are copied to (a directory on) a USB Stick, then the application can be run from
the stick without needing to install anything on the user's computer.

In use the application will write log files to the user's %APPLOCALDATA%\Keratoconus\logging directory, 
and if use is made of the "User preferences" menu then the preferences will be stored in 
%APPLOCALDATA%\Keratoconus\prefs.
